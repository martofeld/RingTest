If this bill passes, all such software made by American companies or organizations (Signal, Whatsapp, etc.), would be illegal (at least for Americans) unless the software had a backdoor built into it for the US government to be able to access the encrypted data.</p>\n\n<p>The law establishes a precedent for other nations to follow, and for further legislation to be passed, such as requiring encryption data to be unencrypted on demand (like in Australia), or outlawing encryption outright. The EFF has already spoken out about it (it&#39;s even worse than the EARN IT Act from three months ago). For these reasons, even non-Americans should be concerned.</p>\n\n<p>It does nothing to stop criminals, either. They will continue downloading and using encrypted software, or encrypting data on backdoored devices. All it will do is give a <strong>huge</strong> blow to average Americans who use American software. There will be obvious security problems having a built-in backdoor (criminals and hackers would exploit it), and the bill would set the precedent that encryption and privacy are bad/illegal/etc. Many businesses might leave the country, and people would lose their privacy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you are an American:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm\">Contact your two US senators</a>. Tell them to vote <strong>NO</strong> on the <strong>Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm\">https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm</a></p>\n\n<p>If your senator says they support the bill because &quot;encryption helps child traffickers and terrorists&quot;, respond with the aforementioned reasons listed above. The reality line is: it won&#39;t stop criminals.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
